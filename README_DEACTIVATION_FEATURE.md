## 🎯 What This Feature Does

### Problem It Solves
❌ **Before:** Members share accounts with friends to avoid paying separate memberships

✅ **After:** You can immediately deactivate accounts caught sharing, preventing unauthorized gym access

### How It Works
1. **Detection:** Staff catches someone sharing their account
2. **Action:** Admin/staff changes account status to "Deactivated"
3. **Result:** Member can't log in, member gets notification, action is logged

### Key Benefits
- ✅ **Non-destructive:** Data is preserved
- ✅ **Reversible:** Can reactivate anytime
- ✅ **Auditable:** Full log of who deactivated whom and when
- ✅ **Automatic:** Member gets notification automatically
- ✅ **Easy:** Just change a dropdown value
